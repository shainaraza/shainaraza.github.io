    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Hello! I am Dr. Shaina Raza, a dedicated and passionate Computer Scientist specializing in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Responsible AI. With over a decade of experience bridging academia and industry, I have cultivated a deep expertise in developing and leading projects focused on the ethical application of AI technologies.</p>

    <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Currently, I serve as an Applied Machine Learning Scientist at the Vector Institute in Toronto, where I spearhead initiatives aimed at creating new datasets and designing foundational models that align with the highest standards of governance and technical excellence. My commitment to advancing AI extends beyond project leadership; I am deeply involved in mentoring emerging scientists and engineers, fostering a culture of innovation and ethical responsibility in AI practices.</p>

    <p><strong>Research and Academic Contributions:</strong> My academic journey has been driven by a pursuit to understand and enhance the interplay between AI and societal needs, particularly focusing on fairness in generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Holding a PhD in Computer Science from Toronto Metropolitan University, my dissertation explored the dynamics of news recommendation systems, balancing accuracy with diversity to improve user experience and trust.</p>

    <p><strong>Vision and Values:</strong> I am a staunch advocate for equitable and responsible AI, committed to dismantling biases within AI systems and ensuring that the benefits of AI are accessible to all. Through rigorous research, thoughtful mentorship, and proactive industry engagement, I aim to influence both current and future AI applications, ensuring they serve the broader goals of society.</p>

    <p><strong>Looking Forward:</strong> As I continue to engage with complex AI challenges, my goal is to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve while steadfastly upholding ethical standards. I look forward to collaborating with peers and organizations that share my vision of a more inclusive and fair digital future.</p>
